## Prompts
### Prompt 1
Complete this assignment by using the openweather API and the API from, https://api.openuv.io/api. Here is the assignement details Use OpenWeatherMap for this lab! Connect to its API and see what information you get back from it. Don’t forget to check out the HTTP response headers: do they include extra metadata not found in the JSON that you might find useful?
Find another free (you are not allowed to pay for anything) API that provides some other kind of data (your choice!). Do the same as with the OpenWeatherMap API.
Next, write a web app to show the weather for Troy, NY, and then – think “creativity,” fill out the rest of your app with other information provided to you by both of your APIs.
It is important to check out the API documentation for both of your APIs to see what data you can get… you might be surprised how much you can get!
Use CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap/jQuery/whatever (as long as it’s not a web framework) to make your web app interesting! Make sure you have valid HTML and CSS (warnings OK, but no errors of your own making… -5 if there are HTML errors; -5 if there are CSS errors).
